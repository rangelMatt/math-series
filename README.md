## How do you run tests?

1. Created test and ran `pytest`
2. Imported formula from series module to test_series module
3. Run `pytest`
4. Fleshed out formula in series module
5. Run `pytest`
   - If failed, tweak check for error and refactor accordingly
   - If Pass, proceed to next formula.

## Any tests of note?

Test three for the sum_series function wasn't something I was expecting. It put out 'None' and I was expected 0. If I get more time I am going to revisit this and play with that one some more.

## Resubmit notes

I was able to give sum_series another look, and I laughed when I looked at it. I **totally* looked at the lesson incorrectly. I must have been tired.
